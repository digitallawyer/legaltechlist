Getting Set-Up

This project is built on a Ruby on Rails framework and currently uses a Postgresql database. You'll need to make sure you have rails installed in order for the project to work locally. If you don't have it installed already here's a great tutorial for Mac users:
	https://launchschool.com/blog/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-development-environment-for-mac-os-x (follow steps 1-4 and then run gem install rails)
Windows:

Now you're ready to get start setting up the project.
1. Move to the directory you'd like in your terminal window and clone the repo
		git clone https://github.com/digitallawyer/legaltechlist.git
   Alternatively, you may use github Desktop or manually download the repo into the directory you want.
2. Start running postgresql as a daemon in the background
		brew services start postgresql
	NOTE: This you can stop this running with brew services stop postgresql
3. Make sure you're now in the repo directory in terminal and run
		bundle install
		bundle update
4. With all the proper gems installed you're almost there. Now we need to get the database.
		rake db:create
		rake db:migrate
5. Lastly, import the csv for testing
		rake csv:import
