    # Merge duplicate directory entries into one canonical survivor. This is the real
    # resolution for a list_duplicate_candidates pair: pick the clean-identity record as
    # the keeper and fold the other(s) in — blank keeper fields are filled from the
    # duplicates (e.g. funding data), all associations (tags, business models, target
    # clients, proposals, import rows, attachments) transfer to the keeper, any successor
    # references are repointed, and the duplicates are deleted. Merging is DESTRUCTIVE, so
    # it previews by default and only executes when authorized (human_approved or a
    # confidence at/above the server threshold).

Pass keep_id (the survivor to keep) and merge_ids (the duplicate ids to fold in and delete). Blank keeper fields are filled from the duplicates (identity stays the keeper's; gaps like funding data get folded), all associations transfer to the keeper, successor references are repointed, and the duplicates are deleted so the pair drops out of the dup queue. DESTRUCTIVE: it returns a dry-run PREVIEW (filled_fields + transferred_associations, nothing deleted) unless you authorize it with human_approved=true (after a human review) or a confidence at/above the server threshold. Refuses to delete a duplicate that is itself acquired or has a successor link (keep that record instead, or record the acquisition first)."
