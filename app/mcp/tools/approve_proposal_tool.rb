      description "Approve a proposal into a draft (publish=false) or publish it live (publish=true). Publish defaults to true when human_approved=true, and to false otherwise. Re-calling with publish=true on a proposal that was previously approved as an invisible draft promotes that draft to visible (no new company is created). To add a historical/already-acquired company in one step, pass status (e.g. \"acquired\", \"inactive\") so it publishes straight into that lifecycle state (never appearing as active), and/or an acquisition payload to record the acquirer at publish time. Publish live autonomously only when you are certain: the quality gate passes, there are no duplicate signals, and you pass a high confidence (>= the server threshold). Otherwise leave it for a human, or pass human_approved=true only after a human approves in Slack."
