    # Approving a proposal creates the company hidden; publication was only reachable by
    # approving again, which the duplicate gate then blocked because the draft from the
    # first approval already existed. Eleven approved records sat invisible with 404
    # pages for exactly that reason, and the only remaining route was a second approval
    # that would have minted a duplicate.

Publication still requires the record to pass the same publish gate as any approval, and human_approved=true is required because this puts a page in front of the public. Pass hidden_only=false to no-op safely on an already-visible record."
