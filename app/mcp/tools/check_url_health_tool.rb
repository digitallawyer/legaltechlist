      description "Enqueue asynchronous website reachability checks. Each job fetches a company's main_url (following redirects, with a bot-block/transient-failure allowance) and records url_status = ok, unknown (up but access-restricted or a single transient failure), or broken (gone/unreachable across consecutive checks). A broken URL is a SOFT signal that a company may be inactive — verify before changing status; use update_company_field(status) or record_acquisition to actually update lifecycle. A blind run (limit) selects companies believed active that have not been checked within the ~30-day cooldown; pass company_ids to target specific companies. Returns an enqueue summary right away (checks run async, not inline): result:\"enqueued\", enqueued (count), company_ids (those queued), skipped + skipped_company_ids (requested ids that were unknown or had no main_url), and targeted. Per-URL verdicts land later: poll get_company for the recorded url_status + reason_code, list them with list_companies(url_health_status:\"broken\"|\"ok\"|\"untried\", optionally url_reason:\"dns_failure\"|\"bot_blocked\"|...) or search_companies(url_broken:true), and track totals with get_stats.companies.url_health (ok/broken/unknown/untried/last_run_at plus by_reason). Each verdict carries a reason_code (bot_blocked/tls_untrusted = usually live; dns_failure/http_404/http_410/connection_reset = likely dead) so an \"unknown\" isn't left in limbo. HTTP client errors use one code per status (http_404, http_400, ...); read the live set from get_stats.companies.url_health.by_reason."
