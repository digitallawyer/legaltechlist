# Tiered curation loop for pending proposals: un-enriched proposals get an
# asynchronous enrichment job queued (enrichment runs off the request thread, so
# it is not bound by the HTTP timeout) and are left for a later pass; already-enriched
# proposals are assessed and auto-published only when they pass the quality gate and
# have no duplicate signals; otherwise they are left for human approval. Discovery
# candidates flagged as nonprofit/advocacy are rejected.
