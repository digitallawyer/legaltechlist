# Compares a duplicate proposal against the record it matched, field by field, so a
# reviewer decides which record survives on evidence rather than on which one the
# system happened to name first.
#
# Detection and resolution are separate steps. Flagging a duplicate says "these are the
# same thing"; it says nothing about which copy is better. Before this existed the
# blocker went straight to "keep that entry and reject this", which throws away a
# proposal that may hold a newer website, a description the index lacks, or a founding
# year nobody had.
#
# Per-field verdicts:
#   identical    both hold the same value
#   only_here    the proposal has a value the existing record lacks  -> mergeable
#   only_there   the existing record has a value the proposal lacks
#   conflict     both hold values and they differ                    -> never auto-merged
#   both_blank   neither holds a value
class DuplicateComparisonService
  # Compared in the order a reviewer reads them, and deliberately limited to fields
  # where "better" is decidable from the record itself.
