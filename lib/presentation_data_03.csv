Legalicity,2015,"10 Dundas Street East, Toronto ON  M5B 2G9",Analytics,n/a,n/a,"Legalicity is the maker of NLPatent, an online tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to evaluate the patentability of new ideas. Our goal is to predict the success of patent applications, thereby reducing the uncertainty and the cost involved in seeking patent protection.  There are over 3,000,000 patent applications filed each year around the world, and that number is growing. But many of these applications are rejected, often because the proposed invention is too similar to existing technology. That means a lot of resources are wasted on unsuccessful applications, since getting a patent is very costly and time-consuming. NLPatent uses state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate the patentability of new ideas. This helps companies and inventors decide whether an invention is worth pursuing.

Think of the company ARM for lawyers.  iolex's founder and CEO Carl Im, a stanford phd in physics, with 20 years of investment banking trading, strategy, and sales experience, believes that the single most distinguishing factor of iolex is the tech leadership:  (1)status quo is to implement legaltech solution within the context of a given mandate --> iolex builds law firm business models around a suite of technology.  (2)status quo is to teach low level programming to lawyers --> we have trained 4 lawyers to speak iolex(a proprietary high level language) to create their own apps, bypassing the programmer.  We have apps with only 20 lines of iolex, and over 500 lines of iolex.  Carl Im is also a senior advisor to Yulchon LLC.  As a senior adviser at Yulchon LLC, he has been driving Yulchon’s digital strategy, eYulchon using the iolex paradigm.  Carl was named one of the 10 pioneers of new thinking by the London Financial Times, and his work has won the Asian Technology and Innovation Initiative of the Year, the Asia-Pacific Innovator of the Year, and the In-House Community Visionary Firm of the Year.  He has just published a paper in A.I. with MIT’s CSAIL.

Automio,2016,New Zealand,Document Automation,n/a,Our vision is to make Law becoming more (E)fficient,"Automio is a cloud-based SaaS platform where professionals can automate their repeat documentation, and serve their clients online.  Automio is a clever interview-bot that people can train to automate the processes used within their business.  When Automio is trained to do a new skill, or carry out a new process (like the process of creating a quote or proposal document), a ""Flow"" is created - an automated product that can be used, bought and sold over and over again without any extra effort. A Flow includes a dynamic interview that, once answered, instantly creates a customised document.  So what do these Flows look like, and how do they work? In place of written code, you teach Automio your processes by drawing visual representations of your own thought processes, business processes, story lines, scripts - ANY logical progression - without the expense of hiring a programmer.

LegalThings One,2014,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Document Automation,n/a,n/a,"LegalThings started in 2014 as a platform to digitize agreements. Rather than just generating text and automating signing, we focused on the logic within a contract. This allowed companies can run their in- and external business processes much more efficient.  Early 2016 we were the first in Europe to add proof of existence (using the Bitcoin blockchain) in our application for the documents being signed / agreed. By doing so we introduced the blockchain to organizations, showing it was useful for more than digital currency.  In 2017 we introduced LiveContracts; A platform to model agreements in such a way that they are easily understandable for both computers and humans.  Breaking down an agreement or law in these understandable pieces has the added benefit that some parts (those considered simple and safe enough) can be executed by computers that have no or very basic AI. Other parts can be left to human interpretation.",https://livecontracts.io,https://twitter.com/livecontracts,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"blockchain, smart contracts",inactive,

ContractRoom,2002,"San Mateo, CA, USA",Document Automation,n/a,n/a,"ContractRoom is a cloud-based negotiation and contract lifecycle management system that changes the way deals get done and how decisions are made. There is a clear distinction between ContractRoom and its competitors, which allows for improved business productivity and predictability. Those differentiators are: Collaboration and Control - it covers the entire process of communication, reviewing, editing, approving and tasking both internally in an organization as well as externally with counterparties. Imagine never having to play a game of email ping-pong again or decipher a redlined MSWord circulated internally and/or externally to determine the sequence in which changes had been made! Or, no long having to constantly check you are working on the correct version of a document when working with multiple parties. ContractRoom does away with all this annoyance!; Transaction and Behavior Data - it captures and leverages transaction and behavior data from the entire back-and-forth negotiation, not just final outcome. ContractRoom keeps a data record of every negotiation offer and counter on any business term or legal clause as well as tracking how long it takes (“timers”) and how many changes are made (“counters”). Once these data sets are aggregated, the system can make inferences for future deal-making and decision-making in real-time, what we call Predictive AgreementTM. So, negotiators no longer have to operate in a vacuum; instead, they benefit from the “collective intelligence” of their peers and can collaborate in a more informed way so as to achieve better business outcomes.",n/a,https://twitter.com/contractroom,https://angel.co/contract-room,n/a,http://www.linkedin.com/company/contractroom,https://www.facebook.com/contractroomproduct/,n/a,"contract management, contract lifecycle management, negotiation",active,
Estate Guru,2014,"Provo, UT",Document Automation,n/a,n/a,"Having helped thousands of people with their estate plans we knew there was a simpler and smarter way. So we assembled the best people we could find – visionaries, techies, programmers, digital media marketers, attorneys, and financial planners. All with one purpose – to create a revolutionary new tool – Estate Guru. While Estate Guru is new, the knowledge and analytics behind it are not. Our team’s intimate knowledge and extensive experience covers every area of the estate planning process. Our collective expertise has been worked into the tool to create and manage estate plans that fit every unique need without breaking the bank. The platform has been designed to create documents in real time for simple accounts while aggressively looking for circumstances that need a traditional approach. Once the attorney has signed off on the legal logic in the tool and has approved the document templates as appropriate for the state(s) they practice, the platform allows the attorney to seamlessly scale their estate planning practice. Attorneys are now able to extend their practice into the offices of financial advisors or the homes of clients. In addition to generating revenue for all the automated work, attorneys get to personally service all the accounts that are too complicated for automation. These complicated accounts can then be billed at the attorneys normal rate. So Estate Guru becomes a way to find profitable accounts. The platform continually reaches out to clients to keep the client and the attorney informed of any life events that may require an update to their estate plan. In this sense, Estate Guru acts as an estate planning CRM. Finally, when clients die, the attorney is notified so they can help with the estate settlement work.

Blika Solutions AB,1989,Stockholm,Marketplace,n/a,n/a,"The Blika platform is the starting point for the digitalization of the legal department and will help you to collect various types of data in a structured process. The solution is developed in modules which means that you can start with the modules you currently need and scale up at a later date by easily switching on additional modules.   All modules are integrated and information is therefore available where it is needed and you avoid double entry of data. In addition, you will be able to automate manual work when working in an integrated one system solution.   Many times several departments use the same base information, e.g. legal entity information and ownership structure, which makes it possible to increase efficiency by having several departments work in the solution (and share the cost). Each department will be able to view and work only with the information they need in their own modules, i.e. each department will not see the other departments data. However, data which is needed in their respective process will be retrieved from other modules where it is available in order to avoid double work and increase quality and efficiency.",https://www.blika.com,n/a,n/a,['https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blika-corptax-ab'],https://www.linkedin.com/company/blika-ab,n/a,n/a,legal operations solution,active,

Estate Apps LLC,2020,"San Francisco, CA",Marketplace,n/a,CourtCorrect tells you what's in all the terms and conditions and contracts you just accept.,"Estate App LLC develops Apps that enable law firms to solve legal client issues while boosting the law firms' marketing.    The Estate Attorney App available on iOS and Android enables law firms to provide clients with a property memo generation tool for completing a property memo -- something that nearly 70% of clients currently do not complete.  The property memo is essential as it designates who is to get a client's personal items upon their death.  Without a completed property memo, beneficiaries are left to divide the sentimental items themselves leading to fights among family members.  An unfinished memo is also a loss for the law firm as it means the firm misses out on billable work reviewing the memo for legal compliance.   The Estate Attorney App enables subscribing law firms to provide a tool that empowers clients by removing the previous barriers to creating the memo.  Specifically, the barriers in the past was the memo was 1) difficult to put together with items located in various places (e.g., banks, closets, locker storage) but having to type it into a desktop computer (solution: mobile app) and 2) difficult to describe similarly looking items (e.g., jewelry or clothing) with just words (solution: include pictures).  The App solves all these problems by making memo generation simple, and importantly, when the memo is to be updated in the future, the information is stored within the device.    The App is also a marketing tool as law firm information is displayed every time the client opens the App and provides an in device annual notification reminding clients to consider updating their estate plan.  It enables law firms to stand apart from other firms while clients perceive the firm as providing high-value.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,https://www.linkedin.com/company/estate-apps,n/a,n/a,n/a,active,

thingsTHINKING GmbH,2017,"Karlsruhe, Germany",eDiscovery,n/a,n/a,"The semantic modeling of clauses and texts - aka understanding the meaning of clauses - enables the system to assess the clauses and contracts holistically. It allows a direct comparison of contracts based on their meaning rather than on the actual wording. Using this technology, the system can come up with similar clauses during writing, highlight duplicates and potential contradictions.  Another use case is to automatically process, understand, route, and compare incoming documents with internal standards.  Additionally, the semantic processing of contract text through AI can help by detecting inapplicable, missing information, and unclear formulation  as depicted below. The system suggests potential flaws in clauses and makes optimization suggestions to the editor of the contract.  The system is provided as micro services and can therefore integrate into any given (computerized) process within a law firm. We are aware of the fact that there is no standard for the legal domain rather than historically developed internal “standards” for software usage per each law firm/practise.",https://thingsTHINKING.net,https://twitter.com/ttgmbh,n/a,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thingsthinking,https://www.linkedin.com/company/thingsthinking,n/a,n/a,"semantics, nlu, nlp",inactive,
